# OOP_programe

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code examples and programs for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The goal is to provide a clear and practical understanding of all major OOP topics through well-documented and easy-to-follow code.

---

### About the Project

This project is a personal library of OOP programs designed for learning and reference. Whether you are a student learning about OOP for the first time or a developer looking to refresh your knowledge, you will find examples covering a wide range of fundamental principles. All code is organized by topic to make it easy to find what you're looking for.

### Topics Covered

The programs in this repository demonstrate the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming. You will find code examples for:

* **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, creating objects, and understanding their state and behavior.
* **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers (public, private, protected) to bundle data and methods, protecting data from external access.
* **Inheritance**: Creating new classes (derived classes) from existing ones (base classes) to reuse and extend functionality.
* **Polymorphism**: Demonstrating methods that can take on different forms, often through method overloading and overriding.
* **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
* **Constructors and Destructors**: Initializing and cleaning up objects.
* **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Designing blueprints for classes and enforcing a contract.

### Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

You will need to have a programming language compiler or interpreter installed, depending on the language used in the code examples (e.g., a C++, Java, or Python environment).

#### Cloning the Repository

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the code.
3.  Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/parth34patil/OOP_programe.git](https://github.com/parth34patil/OOP_programe.git)
    ```

### How to Use

Once cloned, you can navigate into the repository and explore the different folders for each OOP topic. Each folder contains code examples that you can compile and run.

For example, to run a Java program demonstrating polymorphism, you would navigate to the `Polymorphism` folder and compile and run the Java file.

Feel free to use this code for learning, practice, or as a reference for your own projects.
